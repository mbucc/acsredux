	parse - static factory method focussed on parsing
	get - gets the value of something
	is - checks if something is true
	with - the immutable equivalent of a setter
	plus - adds an amount to an object
	minus - subtracts an amount from an object
	to - converts this object to another type
	at - combines this object with another, such as date.atTime(time)"
